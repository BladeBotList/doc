### Authentication

#### **Why do I need authorization?**

_For security reasons we need to make some endpoints only accessible while you add a authorization token on headers._

**Example:**
| Header | Value |
|---|---|
| **Authorization** | `MyPowerFulAPIkeyToBeAuthenitificated` |

### Bot Statistics

_We highly recommands you to use our [**NPM MODULE**](https://npmjs.com/package/bbl-api), this will make data posting easier._

**Posting data is also recommanded for big bots and bots which want to be [certified](https://bladebotlist.xyz/certify).**
